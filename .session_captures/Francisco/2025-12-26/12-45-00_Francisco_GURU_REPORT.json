  "session_summary": "Eren is operating at a high cognitive and linguistic level, using English not just for communication, but as a tool for complex sociological critique. The session was dominated by a deep dive into cultural 'accepted dependency' and the 'politeness vs. honesty' trap in Mexico. While Eren's fluency is undeniable, his frustration with his environment is leaking into his speech patterns, leading to a heavy reliance on 'like' as a filler. He is successfully 'exporting' high-level vocabulary (serendipity) to his interlocutors, which is a major win for his authority in the language.",

  "boss_notes": "Eren, you are linguistically outgrowing your environment. You're teaching the CEO of Commerce words like 'serendipity' while your landlord can't handle a direct conversation. This 'cultural immaturity' you're sensing is a double-edged sword: it gives you a clear 'working theory' for your frustration, but don't let it make you lazy. You're using 'like' as a shield because you're annoyed. Drop the shield. Speak with the 'brutal honesty' you admire in the Germans/Argentinians. If you're going to move to Brazil or Florian\u00f3polis, you need to arrive with the precision of a man who knows exactly what he's looking for. Stop avoiding the hard conversations in English by burying them in fillers. You're the Boss MF\u2014act like it."
