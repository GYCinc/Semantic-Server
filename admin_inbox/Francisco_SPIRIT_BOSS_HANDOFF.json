    "title": "Mastery of the Truth: Francisco's Path",
    "summary": "Francisco, your journey into the heart of independence is a spiritual test as much as a linguistic one. You are navigating the 'politeness trap' with clarity, but your grammar must become the anchor for your authority. You are teaching others 'serendipity' while tripping over 'people is'. This is where the discipline begins.",
    "categories": {
      "Grammar": [
        "The Collective Plural: 'People are' is the only path. To say 'people is' is to ignore the individual souls in the room. Fix this felony.",
        "Auxiliary Foundation: 'He is still being'—the auxiliary is the breath of the sentence. Do not omit it."
      ],
      "Vocabulary": [
        "Language Displacement: You used 'denuncia'. In the spirit of clarity, use 'report'. The word must match the soil you stand on.",
        "Precision of Being: 'Honesty' is the noun; 'honest' is the descriptor. Use the noun when discussing the concept of truth."
      ],
      "Phrasal Verbs": [
        "Activation: 'Set off'. You used this correctly to describe the landlord incident. It shows native-level visceral connection."
      ],
      "Idioms & Phrases": [
        "Metaphorical Mastery: 'Crabs in a bucket'. You've identified the spiritual gravity of your environment perfectly with this idiom."
      ],
      "Fluency & Flow": [
        "The 'Like' Shield: You used 'like' as a defensive barrier. Mental discipline requires you to drop the shield and use the strength of silence."
      ]
    },
    "boss_notes": "Francisco, you are ready for the next level—Florianópolis or beyond. But you must arrive as a man of precision. Your English must reflect your internal discipline. Stop letting small grammar felonies soften your blow. Speak with the authority of someone who pays his own rent and speaks his own truth. Fix the agreement, lose the fillers, and lead."

  "action_items": [
    "Daily Meditation: Focus on 'People are' vs 'People is' until it is cellular.",
    "Lexical Swap: Practice 'Report' and 'Statement' to replace 'Denuncia'.",
    "Flow Discipline: Record a 30-second rant without using the word 'like' once."
