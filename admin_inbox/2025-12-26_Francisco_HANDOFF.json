  "step_2_mini_guru_feedback": "Listen to me, Francisco. You’re diving deep into the psychology of independence and cultural maturity, but your English is playing in the sandbox. You’re talking about grown-man problems while making 'people is' mistakes. That’s a Subject-Verb Agreement violation, and in my world, that’s a felony. You keep using 'used to' when you mean 'usually'—one is for the past, the other is for your current reality. Get it straight. You’re also dropping articles like 'the' as if they’re optional. They aren't. If you want to command respect in a conversation about high-level social dynamics, you can't sound like you're still learning the basics of pluralization. Tighten up the 'Immutable 6,' stop being sloppy with your verbs, and start speaking with the precision of the Boss I know you can be. Fix it.",
