    "summary": "Francisco, you're discussing complex cultural sociology with high cognitive effort. You correctly identify 'accepted dependency' as a major hurdle. However, your grammar is lagging behind your ideas. You're trying to fly a jet with a lawnmower engine.",
    "categories": {
      "Grammar": [
        "Felony: Subject-Verb Agreement. 'People are', not 'people is'. Stop treating a crowd like a single person.",
        "Omitted auxiliaries: 'He is still being' requires the 'is'. Don't be lazy with the foundations."
      ],
      "Vocabulary": [
        "Lexical precision: You used 'denuncia'—use 'report' or 'official statement' in English context.",
        "Word Form: 'The honesty', not 'the honest'. Precision matters when you're being direct."
      ],
      "Phrasal Verbs": [
        "Win: 'Set off'. native usage to describe your reaction to the landlord. More of this, less avoidance."

        "Framework: 'Working theory'. Using this makes your complaints sound like intellectual analysis. Keep it."
      ],
      "Idioms & Phrases": [
        "Cultural Win: 'Crabs in a bucket'. Perfectly describes the social gravity you're feeling."
      ],
      "Fluency & Flow": [
        "Filler Audit: You used 'like' over 200 times. It's a verbal tick that kills your authority. Use silence instead."
      ]
    },
    "boss_notes": "Francisco, your English is a fortress but you're letting the basic S-V agreement errors act like termites. You're teaching words like 'serendipity' to CEOs while slipping on 'people is'. Stop being a 'maricon son riente' with your own progress. If you want to move to Brazil and be independent, you need to arrive with the linguistic precision of a man who pays his own rent. Drop the fillers, fix the agreement, and lead the conversation. You're the Boss."

    "Replace 'like' with 'actually', 'frankly', or a meaningful pause.",
